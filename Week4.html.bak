    <p>A golf cart (alternatively known as a golf buggy or golf car[a]) is a
      small motorized vehicle designed originally to carry two golfers and their
      golf clubs around a golf course with less effort than walking. Over time,
      variants were introduced that were capable of carrying more passengers,
      had additional utility features, or were certified as a street legal
      low-speed vehicle.</p>
    <p>A traditional golf cart, capable of carrying two golfers and their clubs,
      is generally around 4 feet (1.2 m) wide, 8 feet (2.4 m) long and 6 feet
      (1.8 m) high, weighing between 900 to 1,000 pounds (410 to 450 kg) and
      capable of speeds up to about 15 miles per hour (24 km/h).[b] The price of
      a golf cart can range anywhere from under US$1,000 to well over US$20,000
      per cart, depending on how it is equipped.</p>
    <p>Reportedly, the first use of a motorized cart on a golf course was by JK
      Wadley of Texarkana, who saw a three-wheeled electric cart being used in
      Los Angeles to transport senior citizens to a grocery store. Later, he
      purchased a cart and found that it worked poorly on a golf course.[2] The
      first electric golf cart was custom-made in 1932, but did not gain
      widespread acceptance.[3] In the 1930s until the 1950s the most widespread
      use of golf carts was for those with disabilities who could not walk
      far.[4] By the mid 1950s the golf cart had gained wide acceptance with US
      golfers.[5]</p>
